# Codename Boards

A TODO list app (soon to be a kanban task board) that works entirely in the browser. It uses IndexedDB as a persistent storage for data.

Built with:
- React
- Redux
- Vite

## Getting started with development

1. Install dependencies
	```sh
	npm install
	```
2. Run the dev-server
	```sh
	npm run dev
	# or add --host flag to expose the server to the local network
	npm run dev -- --host
	```
